# Information on the Provided Project Files

## Overview

* All project files are Visual Studio 2012 solutions.
* `plin` (v0.9) is standalone.
* `plin_showcase` (v0.9) requires compiled `plin` (v0.9) to work. Build it yourself or download a compiled exectuable. You'll probably need to add the reference to the application yourself. The solution is set up to copy `plin.exe` to the output folder.

## Adding a Reference to `plin.exe`

1. Right-click on *References* in the *Solution Explorer*.
2. Select *Add Reference*.
3. In the *Browse* tab select `plin.exe`. You may need to click browse to add the proper file to the list.

You might want to use *plin.xml* file so Visual Studio would provide you a description on each function and type.
